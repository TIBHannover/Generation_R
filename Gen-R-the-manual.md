## Gen R: The Manual

### Writing style guide

Generally Chicago Manual of Style - 17th edition (CMOS) is used as of July 2018, but divergence is allowed depending on the contribution and context. For example if we have a British contribution using large amounts of British styling and/or spelling. The objective of using CMOS is for consistency for the reader across the site.

As ever the golden rule is consistency.

#### Rules and exceptions

 * Comma after e.g., but not always depends on context.
