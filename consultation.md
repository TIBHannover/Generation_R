# Consultation Documentation

Started June 2018

## Questions

1. How to build a collaborative Open Research Notebook.
2. Working on contributing to learning resources with our first theme of Software Citation and the partners Open Science MOOC.
3. Ideas about what is missing on the Open Science community and how Generation R could lend a hand.

## What is the consultation about?

We have an outline of a plan for how to organize the Generation R editorial platform. This outline proposes a three channel approach, using

+ blogging,
+ discussion, and
+ documentation resources.

The idea is then to use this three channel combination to help contribute to partner’s learning resources, such as with Open Science MOOC.

We have established the blog using WordPress, but our other channels are a work in progress and here is where we are reaching out to look for pointers and recommendations.

### What we’re thinking about:

+ How as an editorial platform and network can we support the Open Science community.
+ Helping evaluating a way forward and consulting on our platform plans below.
+ Asking specific platform questions, for example what technologies or platforms to use to make a collaborative Open Research Notebook.
